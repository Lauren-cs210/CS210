For this project, the goal was to create a program to help a grocery store keep track of frequently bought produce. This program would aid them in re-organizing their produce section.  This projecy highlights my ability to keep the code within main() neat and easy to read.  However, because of how the files are opened, it would be difficult to open a different file.  To improve my code, I would make it simpler to change which file was opened.  This would enable the grocery store to upload different product data and re-organize different sections.  
This was my first time using maps, so the most difficult part for me was figuring out how to transfer the file's data into a map.  To overcome this, I found resources that explained the practical uses of maps and applied those practices to my own code.  Along with learning about maps, I also became more familiar with designing the functions within a program, a skill that will aid me in future projects.  In my design, I split each task of the program into different functions.  This makes the program easily maintainable and adaptable while improving readability.
